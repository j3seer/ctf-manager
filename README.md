# Functionalities 

### Adding a new CTF
You can add CTFs that your team will be playing

This will create a channel under the category "CTF" with the title of the CTF in CTFtime and will send generated credentials for that CTF and pin it in the channel

> **Warning**
\- THE CHANNEL WILL ONLY BE AVAILBLE TO ADMINS AT FIRST CREATION

This is intentional to keep track of who played a CTF with your team

The following image is from the view of a normal member / user before accepting their join request

### Listing upcoming CTFs

This functionality will list CTFs that your team will participate in the future

### Removing and Archiving CTFs

- Archiving

- Unarchiving

![](/images/unarchive.png)

You can remove CTFs by id or in bulk with `*`

![](/images/remove_bulk.png)
> **Warning**
\- DO NOT archive or remove channel by yourself (by dragging to archived ctfs category or deleting by hand), this will cause issues with the db and you'll have to clean the deleted event row by hand in the database.db file<br><br>- Removing ctfs before archiving will delete the channels



------------
### Join request

Normal users can request to join a CTF by using the join command and admins can Accept or Deny these requests

![](/images/join_request.png)

Admins will be able to accept or deny join requests

![](/images/accept_join_request.png)

Once an admin accepts a join request the user will be able to send message and check generated credentials for the CTF

![](/images/join_request2.png)

Admins can also list all requests and check their status

![](/images/join_list.png)

------------

### Bot Reminder settings

Any user can choose if they want to be reminded of the starting CTF

![](/images/reminder.png)

The reminder will be able to remind users **when the events starts** as well as:

- 8 hours before start
- 4 hours before start
- 1 hours before start
- 30 minutes before start

Here an example of the reminder

> **Warning**
\- PLEASE DO NOT ADD THE ROLE BY YOURSELF THAT'LL CREATE ISSUES WITH THE DB

# Configurations
1- Create a bot admin role such as "ctf-manager-admin"

2- Give the bot the admin role "ctf-manager-admin"

3- Create a public bot channel and give the admin permissions to send messages

4- Create a private channel exclusive for the bot admin role 

(You can give the admin role to users who you want to add as admins)

5- Create a reminder channel visible to all members but only the admin role can send messages

6- Modify config.py


```python
# bot constants
token = "token_here" # discord token
prefix = "$"  # put prefix here
link = "https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=<your_client_id>&permissions=275146599504&scope=bot"  # put bot invite link here

# admin stuff
ownerid = "your_discord_id"  # put your id here
admin_role = "ctf-manager-admin"
admin_channel_id = "admin_channel_id"

# remind settings
reminder_role = "remind-me"
reminder_role_id = "reminder_role_id"
remind_me_channel_id ="reminder_channel_id"

# team
teamname="/bin/cat" # this will be used for generated credentials
member_role="member"  
```

To get the role id of a role you need to go to server roles

![](/images/role_id.png "Role id")

To get the channel id of a channel you need to right click and "Copy channel id"
